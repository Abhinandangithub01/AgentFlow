## üîß Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Configure AWS CLI

```bash
aws configure
```

Input:
- AWS Access Key ID: `your-aws-access-key-id`
- AWS Secret Access Key: `your-aws-secret-access-key`
- Default region: `us-east-1`
- Default output format: `json`

**Verify:**
```bash
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

- [ ] AWS CLI configured
- [ ] Credentials verified

### Step 2: Run Deployment Script

```powershell
cd C:\Users\mail2\CascadeProjects\agent-platform
.\scripts\deploy-amplify.ps1
```

**What it does:**
- Creates CodeCommit repository
- Pushes code
- Creates Amplify app
- Connects branch
- Starts deployment

- [ ] Script completed without errors
- [ ] Note your App ID: `________________`

### Step 3: Configure Environment Variables in Amplify

Go to: https://console.aws.amazon.com/amplify

1. Select your app
2. Go to **App settings** ‚Üí **Environment variables**
3. Click **Manage variables**

Add these variables:

| Key | Value | Example |
|-----|-------|---------|
| `AUTH0_SECRET` | Generate new 64-char string | `abc123...` |
| `AUTH0_BASE_URL` | Your Amplify URL | `https://main.dxxxxx.amplifyapp.com` |
| `AUTH0_ISSUER_BASE_URL` | Your Auth0 domain | `https://dev-xyz.auth0.com` |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_ID` | From Auth0 app | `abc123xyz` |
| `AUTH0_CLIENT_SECRET` | From Auth0 app | `secret123` |
| `OPENAI_API_KEY` | (Optional) OpenAI key | `sk-...` |

**Generate new AUTH0_SECRET for production:**
```powershell
-join ((48..57) + (97..122) | Get-Random -Count 64 | % {[char]$_})
```

- [ ] All environment variables added
- [ ] Values double-checked
- [ ] AUTH0_SECRET regenerated (don't reuse local secret!)

### Step 4: Update Auth0 Production URLs

Get your Amplify URL from the console (e.g., `https://main.d123456.amplifyapp.com`)

Update Auth0 application settings:

**Allowed Callback URLs:**
```
http://localhost:3000/api/auth/callback,
https://main.d123456.amplifyapp.com/api/auth/callback
```

**Allowed Logout URLs:**
```
http://localhost:3000,
https://main.d123456.amplifyapp.com
```

**Allowed Web Origins:**
```
http://localhost:3000,
https://main.d123456.amplifyapp.com
```

- [ ] Production URLs added to Auth0
- [ ] Kept localhost URLs for development
- [ ] Saved changes in Auth0

### Step 5: Trigger Redeploy

After adding environment variables, redeploy:

Option A - Via Console:
1. Go to Amplify app
2. Click **Redeploy this version**

Option B - Via CLI:
```bash
aws amplify start-job --app-id YOUR_APP_ID --branch-name main --job-type RELEASE --region us-east-1
```

- [ ] Redeployment triggered
- [ ] Build completed successfully

### Step 6: Test Production Deployment

Visit your Amplify URL: `https://main.dxxxxxx.amplifyapp.com`

Test checklist:
- [ ] Landing page loads
- [ ] Click "Get Started"
- [ ] Redirected to Auth0 login
- [ ] Can sign up / log in
- [ ] Redirected back to dashboard
- [ ] Dashboard loads correctly
- [ ] Can navigate to agent details
- [ ] Can access create agent page
- [ ] Logout works
- [ ] Can log back in

## üêõ Troubleshooting

### Build Fails on Amplify

**Check:**
1. Amplify build logs for errors
2. `amplify.yml` configuration
3. Node version compatibility
4. All dependencies in `package.json`

**Common fixes:**
```bash
# Update amplify.yml if needed
# Ensure Next.js version is compatible
# Check for missing dependencies
```

### Auth0 Redirect Loop

**Check:**
1. Callback URLs exactly match (including https://)
2. `AUTH0_BASE_URL` matches Amplify URL
3. `AUTH0_SECRET` is set in Amplify env vars
4. No trailing slashes in URLs

### Environment Variables Not Working

**Check:**
1. All variables added in Amplify console
2. App redeployed after adding variables
3. No typos in variable names
4. Values don't have extra quotes or spaces

### 404 on Routes

**Check:**
1. Next.js dynamic routes properly configured
2. `amplify.yml` has correct artifacts
3. App uses App Router (not Pages Router)

## üìä Success Criteria

Your deployment is successful when:

‚úÖ Production URL is accessible  
‚úÖ Auth0 login/logout works  
‚úÖ All pages load without errors  
‚úÖ Dashboard shows agent data  
‚úÖ Navigation between pages works  
‚úÖ Responsive on mobile devices
