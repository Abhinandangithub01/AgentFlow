## 🚀 How It Works

### **Agent Execution Flow**:

1. **User clicks "Run Now" on Email Agent**
2. API calls `/api/agents/[id]/execute`
3. Agent fetches mock emails (in production: Gmail API)
4. For each email:
   - **GROQ analyzes** → category, priority, sentiment
   - **GROQ extracts tasks** → action items, deadlines
   - **GROQ generates draft** → professional response
5. Results sorted by priority
6. Activity logged to dashboard

## 📊 Real Example

### **Input Email**:
```
Subject: Urgent: Project Deadline Change
From: client@company.com
Body: We need to move the project deadline from Friday to Wednesday. 
Can you accommodate this change? Please confirm ASAP.
```

### **GROQ AI Analysis**:
```json
{
  "category": "urgent",
  "priority": "high",
  "requiresAction": true,
  "suggestedActions": [
    "Confirm deadline change",
    "Update project timeline",
    "Notify team members"
  ],
  "summary": "Client requesting urgent deadline change from Friday to Wednesday",
  "sentiment": "neutral"
}
```

### **Extracted Tasks**:
```json
{
  "tasks": [
    {
      "title": "Update project deadline",
      "description": "Change deadline from Friday to Wednesday",
      "priority": "high",
      "dueDate": "2025-01-22",
      "assignee": null
    },
    {
      "title": "Confirm with client",
      "description": "Send confirmation of deadline change",
      "priority": "high",
      "dueDate": "2025-01-20",

    }
  ],
  "actionItems": [
    "Confirm ability to meet new deadline",
    "Update project timeline",
    "Notify team of change"
  ]
}
```

### **Generated Draft**:
```json
{
  "subject": "Re: Urgent: Project Deadline Change",
  "body": "Hi,\n\nThank you for reaching out. I understand the need to move the project deadline to Wednesday. I'm reviewing our current timeline and will confirm our ability to accommodate this change within the next few hours.\n\nI'll get back to you shortly with a definitive answer.\n\nBest regards",
